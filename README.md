# Smart-To-Do-App-with-Time-Aware-Reminders

What's Included:
Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS, the app is designed to look good on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Task Management: You can add new tasks with a name, deadline (date and time), priority (High, Medium, Low), and an optional category. You can also edit existing tasks and delete them.

Task Completion: Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually struck through and moved to the bottom when sorted.

Time-Aware Highlighting: Tasks that are "Due Soon" (within the next hour) or "Overdue" are highlighted with distinct colors (yellow and red, respectively) and icons.

Browser Notifications: The app will request permission to send browser notifications. If granted, it will notify you for tasks that are due within 5 minutes or are already overdue. Notifications are only sent once per task until the task is edited or the page is refreshed.

Sorting Options: You can sort your tasks by priority, category (alphabetically), or due date (earliest first).

Local Storage: All your tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so they persist even if you close and reopen the browser tab.

How to Use:
Add a Task: Fill in the "Task Name," "Deadline," "Priority," and "Category" fields, then click "Add Task."

Edit a Task: Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon next to a task. The form will pre-fill with the task's details. Make your changes and click "Update Task."

Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" (trash can) icon next to a task.

Mark as Completed: Check the box next to a task to mark it as completed. Uncheck to mark as incomplete.

Sort Tasks: Use the "Sort by Priority," "Sort by Category," or "Sort by Due Date" buttons to reorder your task list.

Notifications: When you first load the app, you'll see a prompt to enable notifications. Please allow them to receive reminders.
